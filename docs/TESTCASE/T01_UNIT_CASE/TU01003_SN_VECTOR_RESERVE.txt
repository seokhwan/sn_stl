@desc
The reserve() function reserves (i.e., allocates) memory for having the items with given size.
It specifically tests
- What happens if the given size arugment is smaller than current size?
- After a successful reserve() call, the capacity() returnes appropriate size ? 
- The items that are already in the container are also reserved ?
